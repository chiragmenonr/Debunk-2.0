## Improved Homepage Design

Transform the homepage into a clean, minimal landing experience that clearly communicates the app's value and provides immediate entry points to start practicing.

### New Hero Section

A sophisticated, minimal hero section featuring:
- **Impactful headline** with elegant serif typography emphasizing the core value proposition (e.g., "Master the Art of Persuasion")
- **Concise tagline** explaining what the app does in one clear sentence
- **Two prominent CTA buttons** — one for "Start Debunking" and one for "Start Debating" — allowing users to jump straight into either mode
- **Subtle background accents** using the existing navy/amber color palette for visual interest without distraction

### Feature Highlights (Below the fold)

Compact feature cards showcasing the two modes:
- **Debunk Mode** — Brief explanation with an icon showing users can generate structured arguments all at once
- **Debate Mode** — Brief explanation with an icon showing interactive back-and-forth practice with AI

Each card includes a "Try it" button that routes to the new dedicated practice page.

### How It Works

A simple 3-step visual guide:
1. **Choose your topic** — Enter any statement or claim
2. **Pick your position** — Argue for or against
3. **Practice & improve** — Get AI-powered arguments and feedback

This section uses icons and minimal text for quick scanning.

### Separate Practice Page

Move the existing debate generator form to a new `/practice` route:
- The form retains all current functionality (mode toggle, topic input, position selector, etc.)
- Clean, focused layout for an distraction-free experience
- Navigation back to the homepage

### Navigation Updates

- Add a simple navigation bar with logo, "How it Works" anchor link, and Sign In
- Maintain the existing settings and user menu functionality
